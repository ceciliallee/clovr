<p>Clovr is a social networking event for UNC CS students, born of the need for building new connections during COVID-19. It strives to provide a welcoming space for students to make friends, meet people with similar interests, and take time to destress from school. Participants complete a questionnaire and receive matches with similar interests created through our algorithm, with the event culminating in a Zoom Reveal Event* where matches are revealed.<br></p>
